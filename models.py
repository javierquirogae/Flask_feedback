# Part 7: Give us some more feedback!
# Itâ€™s time to add another model.

# Create a Feedback model for SQLAlchemy. Put this in a models.py file.

# It should have the following columns:

# id - a unique primary key that is an auto incrementing integer
# title - a not-nullable column that is at most 100 characters
# content - a not-nullable column that is text
# username - a foreign key that references the username column in the users table

# email - a not-nullable column that is unique and no longer than 50 characters.
